## Purpose

Typically in R it is difficult to create nice US [choropleths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Choropleth_map) that include Alaska and Hawaii. The functions presented here attempt to elegantly solve this problem by manually moving these states to a new location and providing a simple features ([`sf`](https://github.com/r-spatial/sf)) object for mapping and visualization. This allows the user to easily add spatial data or features to the US map.

## Available Map Data

The map data files that we use to plot the maps in R are located in the
[`usmapdata`](https://github.com/pdil/usmapdata) package. These are
generated from the [US Census Bureau cartographic boundary
files](https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/cartographic-boundary.html).
Maps at both the state and county levels are included for convenience.

In `usmap v0.8.0` the `data_year` parameter was added to most package functions, 
allowing the user to select from multiple available years. Since data is now 
stored in `usmapdata`, updates are no longer tied to `usmap` versions.

## Features

### Map Plots

- Plot US maps

```{r plots, fig.align='center'}
states <- plot_usmap("states")
counties <- plot_usmap("counties")

cowplot::plot_grid(states, counties, nrow = 1)
```


- Display only certain states, counties, or regions

```{r more_plots}
library(ggplot2)

mt <- plot_usmap("states", include = .mountain, labels = TRUE)

fl <- plot_usmap("counties", data = countypov, values = "pct_pov_2021", include = "FL") +
  scale_fill_continuous(low = "green", high = "red", guide = "none")

ne <- plot_usmap("counties", data = countypop, values = "pop_2022", include = .new_england) +
  scale_fill_continuous(low = "blue", high = "yellow", guide = "none")

cowplot::plot_grid(mt, fl, ne, nrow = 1)
```


- Transform and add spatial data to map

```{r sf_plot}
library(ggplot2)

# Transform included `usrivers` data set
rivers_transformed <- usmap_transform(usrivers)

river_map <- plot_usmap("counties", color = "gray80") +
  geom_sf(data = rivers_transformed, aes(linewidth = Shape_Length), color = "blue") +
  scale_linewidth_continuous(range = c(0.3, 1.5), guide = "none")

# Transform included `earthquakes` data set
eq_transformed <- usmap_transform(earthquakes)

earthquake_map <- plot_usmap() +
  geom_sf(data = eq_transformed, aes(size = mag), color = "red", alpha = 0.25) +
  scale_size_continuous(guide = "none")

cowplot::plot_grid(river_map, earthquake_map, nrow = 1)
```


### Map Data

- Obtain map data with certain region breakdown
```{r state_map}
us_map(regions = "states")
```

```{r county_map}
us_map(regions = "counties")
```


### FIPS Codes

- Look up FIPS codes for states and counties

```{r fips}
fips("New Jersey")

fips(c("AZ", "CA", "New Hampshire"))

fips("NJ", county = "Mercer")

fips("NJ", county = c("Bergen", "Hudson", "Mercer"))
```


- Retrieve states or counties with FIPS codes

```{r fips_info}
fips_info(c("34", "35"))

fips_info(c("34021", "35021"))
```


- Add FIPS codes to data frame

```{r fips_merge, message=FALSE}
library(dplyr)

data <- data.frame(
  state = c("NJ", "NJ", "NJ", "PA"),
  county = c("Bergen", "Hudson", "Mercer", "Allegheny")
)

data %>% rowwise %>% mutate(fips = fips(state, county))
```

  sf::st_crs(9311)
  ```
</details>

This [coordinate reference system (CRS)](https://www.nceas.ucsb.edu/sites/default/files/2020-04/OverviewCoordinateReferenceSystems.pdf) can also be obtained with `usmap::usmap_crs()`.
