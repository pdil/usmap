* Additional or improved documentation (especially new examples, typo fixes, clearer language, etc.)
* Additional or improved tests

If you want to contribute changes to the `usmap` package, [fork the repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) and make your changes. Then [submit a pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request/) which will be reviewed by the project maintainer ([Paolo Di Lorenzo](https://github.com/pdil)) to see if it fits in with the existing codebase. You will be notified if there are any issues with your changes or if it has been accepted.

If you're interested in contributing but are not sure where to begin, check the [usmap issues](https://github.com/pdil/usmap/issues) for ideas of things that can be fixed or added to the package. Contributing is not only limited to submitting actual code either, creating new issues that highlight areas where the package is lacking or can be improved are also greatly appreciated.

When contributing code, please use a consistent styling convention. Try to match [Hadley Wickham's style guide](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html) as closely as possible so that the code is more readable and consistent throughout the package.

Contributing is open to anyone who is willing so feel free to submit pull requests at any time. This way anyone can develop new features, fixes, or enhancements for `usmap` to improve its functionality and place within the `R` ecosystem.
