\usage{
map_with_data(
  data,
  values = "values",
  include = c(),
  exclude = c(),
  na = NA,
  data_year = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{The data that should be joined to a US map. This
parameter should be a data frame consisting of two columns,
a fips code (2 characters for state, 5 characters for county)
and the value that should be associated with that region. The
columns of \code{data} \emph{must} be \code{fips} or \code{state} and
the value of the \code{values} parameter. If both \code{fips} and \code{state}
are provided, this function uses the \code{fips}.}

\item{values}{The name of the column that contains the values to be associated
with a given region. The default is \code{"values"}.}

\item{include}{The regions to include in the resulting map. If \code{regions} is
\code{"states"}/\code{"state"}, the value can be either a state name, abbreviation or FIPS code.
For counties, the FIPS must be provided as there can be multiple counties with the
same name. If states are provided in the county map, only counties in the included states
will be returned.}

\item{exclude}{The regions to exclude in the resulting map. If \code{regions} is
\code{"states"}/\code{"state"}, the value can be either a state name, abbreviation or FIPS code.
For counties, the FIPS must be provided as there can be multiple counties with the
same name. The regions listed in the \code{include} parameter are applied first and the
\code{exclude} regions are then removed from the resulting map. Any excluded regions
not present in the included regions will be ignored.}

\item{na}{The value to be inserted for states or counties that don't have
a value in \code{data}. This value must be of the same type as the \code{value}
column of \code{data}.}

\item{data_year}{The year for which to obtain map data. If the value is NULL,
the most recent year's data is used. If the provided year is not found from
the available map data sets, the next most recent year's data is used.
This can be used if an older data set is being plotted on the US map so that
the data matches the map more accurately. Therefore, the provided value should
match the year of the plotted data set. The default is NULL, i.e. the most
recent available year is used.}
}
\value{
A data frame composed of the map data frame (from \code{\link[=us_map]{us_map()}}) except
an extra column containing the values in \code{data} is included.

The result can be plotted using \code{\link[ggplot2:ggplot]{ggplot2::ggplot()}} or \code{\link[=plot_usmap]{plot_usmap()}}.
