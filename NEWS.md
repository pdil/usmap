# usmap 0.8.0

### New Features
* Add `data_year` parameter to `fips()`, `fips_info()`, `map_with_data()`, `plot_usmap()`, and `us_map()`, see [Issue #110](https://github.com/pdil/usmap/issues/110).
  * Allows user to select the year for which to plot US map.
  * This will allow the user to match the map that is provided to the data they are using.
  * To start with, 2021, 2022, 2023, and 2024 maps are included.
  * Going forward, each year will be added to `usmapdata` (`usmap`'s data repository) and previous years can be accessed with this parameter.
  * `usmapdata v0.4.0` or later is required to use this parameter.
  * If the value provided via `data_year` is not available, the package will select the next year for which data exists.
    * For example, if data sets 2022 and 2023 are available and the user calls `us_map(data_year = 2019)`, 2022 will be used.
    * A warning is presented when this occurs to alert the user.
  * Further reading on the impetus for this change: [major changes made to Connecticut counties in 2023](https://www.ctinsider.com/projects/2023/ct-planning-regions).
  * The old Connecticut counties are available in the 2021 data, 2022 and forward use the new planning regions.

### Improvements
* Update package author email.

# usmap 0.7.1
Released Thursday, March 21, 2024.

### Improvements
* Add citation information to README, see [Issue #86](https://github.com/pdil/usmap/issues/86).
* Update map theme to work with new legend behavior in [ggplot2 3.5.0](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2024/02/ggplot2-3-5-0-legends/#placement).
* Update provided population and poverty (county & state) data sets, see [Issue #88](https://github.com/pdil/usmap/issues/88).
  * Previous data sets from 2015 and 2014, respectively have been updated to 2022 and 2021 versions, respectively.
  * The main change (besides numerical values) is that Connecticut now has the correct FIPS codes in the 2022 county population data set. See [this Federal Register document](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2022/06/06/2022-12063/change-to-county-equivalents-in-the-state-of-connecticut) for more information. The 2021 county data does not include CT updates yet since the new FIPS codes were not made effective until 2022. Poverty data for 2022 is not available yet so the most recently available data from 2021 is included for now.

### Documentation
* Replace `size` with `linewidth` in `plot_usmap()` documentation, see [Issue #89](https://github.com/pdil/usmap/issues/89).

### Technical Changes
* Internal `usmapdata` functions are used for data transformation (i.e. `usmap_transform()`) values for consistency.
  * This allows the same values used to create the map to be used when transforming external data.
  * Values will now only have to be updated in one place.
  * `usmapdata 0.2.2` is now a required dependency because of this change.
* Continue `sf`-based map data file migration.
  * Usage of the `as_sf` parameter in `usmapdata` function calls has been removed.
  * The parameter will be removed from `usmapdata` functions in the future.

# usmap 0.7.0
Released Saturday, January 20, 2024.

This is a major new release for `usmap`. The data has been modernized to be a [simple features (`sf`)](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/) object. This will allow for much greater flexibility in the type of data that can be portrayed on the US map. `us_map()`, `plot_usmap()`, and `usmap_transform()` have been updated to work with these new formats. See the examples in the vignettes and `README` for more information.

### Improvements
* Migrate to new `usmapdata 0.2.0` `sf`-based map data files.
  * Map data produced by `us_map()` is now returned as an `sf` object instead of a standard data frame.
  * Allows for further flexibility in manipulation, easier plotting, and reduced file sizes.
  * There should be no visible changes to existing `usmap` functionality.
  * If something doesn't look right, please [open an issue](https://github.com/pdil/usmap/issues).
* Change the output of `usmap_transform()` in accordance with the `sf` change mentioned above.
  * The output data frame now replaces the `lat`/`lon` columns with a single `geometry` column with the transformed points and can be plotted using `ggplot2::geom_sf()`.
  * Review the included examples and `advanced-mapping` vignette for more details.
* `usmap_transform()` now accepts `sf` objects and automatically transforms its `geometry` column to the projection used by this package.
  * It is now possible to add any geographical features to the plotted map such as rivers, roads, topographical data, etc. using `usmap_transform()` before plotting with `ggplot2::geom_sf()`, see [Issue #12](https://github.com/pdil/usmap/issues/12).
  * See the provided vignettes and examples for more information.
  * Input can now also be in any coordinate reference system, if it is not standard longitude/latitude, it can be specified with the `crs` parameter.
* Add `usrivers` dataset featuring major US rivers.
  * The dataset is provided in an `sf` object and is ready to be transformed with `usmap_transform()` and plotted with `plot_usmap() + ggplot2::geom_sf()`.
* Add visual snapshot tests for more resilient plots, see [Issue #80](https://github.com/pdil/usmap/issues/80).
* Add state abbreviation (`abbr`) column to `citypop` data set.
* Update and standardize documentation throughout the page.
  * Includes updates to formatting, links, and language.
* Rename vignettes to make them easier to find and read in order.

### Bug Fixes
* `plot_usmap()` warnings have been cleaned up, including a defunct warning that didn't make sense.

### Removed
* `output_names` is no longer required as a parameter to `usmap_transform()`.
  * It continues to exist for compatibility but produces a warning and may be removed in a future version of `usmap`.
  * `usmap_transform()` will output its transformation using the `sf` default of `"geometry"` as the column name.

# usmap 0.6.4
Released Monday, December 11, 2023.

### Improvements
* Replace local state and county FIPS files with `usmapdata::fips_data()`.
  * Single source of truth for this data is now housed in `usmapdata`.
  * Data will be updated in sync with shapefile updates.

### Bug Fixes
* FIPS file change resolves issue with Valdez-Cordova Census Area in Alaska, see [Issue #72](https://github.com/pdil/usmap/issues/72).

### Technical Changes
* Resolve all code-linting warnings.
* Increase test coverage to 100%.

# usmap 0.6.0
Released Sunday, February 27, 2022.

### New Features
* Add `input_names` and `output_names` parameters to `usmap_transform`, see [Issue #33](https://github.com/pdil/usmap/issues/33).
* Add `sortAndRemoveDuplicates` parameter to `fips_info`, see [Issue #47](https://github.com/pdil/usmap/issues/47).
  * The default (`FALSE`) value changes existing behavior, to retain existing behavior, change the parameter value to `TRUE`.

### Improvements
* Improve map resolution.
  * More polygons are shown, this has a marginal increase on the data set file sizes but it is negligible.
* Add shape file update history, see [Issue #30](https://github.com/pdil/usmap/issues/30).
* Extract map data frame to external [usmapdata](https://github.com/pdil/usmapdata) package to reduce `usmap` package size, see [Issue #39](https://github.com/pdil/usmap/issues/39).
  * All existing functions (including `us_map()`) should continue to work as usual.
* Add data format examples for `plot_usmap` to "Mapping" vignette, see [Issue #42](https://github.com/pdil/usmap/issues/42).

### Bug Fixes
* Fix CRS warnings, see [Issue #40](https://github.com/pdil/usmap/issues/40).
* Fix `plot_usmap()` issue when provided data has `"values"` column, see [Issue #48](https://github.com/pdil/usmap/issues/48) and [this Stack Overflow question](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/61111024/trouble-using-plot-usmap-function-in-usmap-package).

# usmap 0.5.2
Released Wednesday, October 7, 2020.

* Update links in documentation.

# usmap 0.5.1
Released Wednesday, October 7, 2020.

* New website for the package: https://usmap.dev
  * Lightweight landing page containing useful information, links, and examples of usmap usage.
* `state` can now be omitted when using `fips()`. In this case, all available FIPS codes are returned, sorted by state abbreviation, see [Issue #28](https://github.com/pdil/usmap/issues/28).
* `fips` can now be omitted when using `fips_info()`. In this case, all available states are returned, sorted by state abbreviation, see [Issue #28](https://github.com/pdil/usmap/issues/28).
* Fix duplicate coordinates from being removed during `usmap_transform` (if value columns differ), see [Issue #32](https://github.com/pdil/usmap/issues/32).
* Prevent [warnings introduced by `ggplot2` v3.3.0](https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2/pull/3346), see [Issue #35](https://github.com/pdil/usmap/issues/35).
* Set minimum R version to 3.5.0. Versions lower than this do not support the latest version of the `rgdal` package.

# usmap 0.5.0
Released Friday, September 13, 2019.

### New Features
* Ability to include county name labels on county maps, see [Issue #14](https://github.com/pdil/usmap/issues/14).
  * They currently work the same as state labels except they include the full county name (excluding the word "County").
* Ability to pass `ggplot2::geom_polygon()` parameters to `plot_usmap()`, see [Issue #15](https://github.com/pdil/usmap/issues/15).
  * This is a breaking change and removes the `lines` parameter. The previous defaults of `color="black"`, `fill="white"`, and `size=0.4` are maintained and will be used for any of those parameters that are omitted.
  * Refer to the `ggplot2::geom_polygon()` documentation for more information.
  * The following aesthetics are supported: `alpha`, `colour`/`color`, `fill`, `linetype`, `size`
  * This feature provides more direct control over the appearance of plots.
* Ability to exclude counties and states with new `exclude` parameter in `us_map`, `map_with_data`, and `plot_usmap`, see [Issue #19](https://github.com/pdil/usmap/issues/19).
* New function (`usmap_transform`) to transform longitude/latitude point data frames into coordinate reference system that matches the plotted map, see [Issue #21](https://github.com/pdil/usmap/issues/21).
  * Also includes `usmap_crs()` to easily access the coordinate reference system used by the package.

### Improvements
* In the data frames provided by `us_map()`, `long` and `lat` have been renamed to `x` and `y`, respectively, see [Issue #16](https://github.com/pdil/usmap/issues/16).
  * This should not affect the behavior of `plot_usmap()` but will be a breaking change for any code that relies on `us_map()`.
* Added contributing guidelines and templates, see [Issue #24](https://github.com/pdil/usmap/issues/24).
  * These can be see in the [.github folder](https://github.com/pdil/usmap/tree/master/.github).

# usmap 0.4.0
Released Sunday, September 16, 2018.

### New Features
* Ability to include state abbreviation labels in state maps, see [Issue #9](https://github.com/pdil/usmap/issues/9).
  * e.g. `plot_usmap(labels = TRUE)`
* Add US Census Bureau regional divisions as constants for quick plotting of certain regions.
  * e.g. `plot_usmap(include = .northeast_region)`
  * The provided regions and divisions can be seen [on this map by the US Census Bureau](https://www2.census.gov/geo/pdfs/maps-data/maps/reference/us_regdiv.pdf).
* Allow ability to include only certain states while viewing county map, see [Issue #11](https://github.com/pdil/usmap/issues/11).
  * e.g. `us_map("counties", include = "TX")` or `plot_usmap("counties", include = c("AZ", "NM"))`

### Improvements
* Vectorize counties in `fips`, see [Issue #10](https://github.com/pdil/usmap/issues/10).
  * e.g. `fips("NJ", c("Bergen", "Hudson"))`
* Allow all columns in the data frame that's passed to `map_with_data()` or `plot_usmap()` to be preserved.

### Bug Fixes
* Add Kusilvak Census Area (FIPS code 02158), replaces Wade Hampton Census Area (FIPS code 02270).

# usmap 0.3.0
Released Sunday, June 3, 2018.

### Improvements
* Update shape files to [2017 versions](https://www.census.gov/geographies/mapping-files/time-series/geo/tiger-line-file.2017.html).
* Improvements to `fips` and `fips_info`:
  * Vectorization support (e.g. enter multiple states in `fips` to receive a vector of corresponding FIPS codes)
  * e.g. `fips(c("AK", "AL"))` or `fips(c("Alaska", "Alabama"))`
  * Mixed abbreviations and full names are also supported: `fips(c("AK", "Alabama"))`
  * Improved warning and error messages.
* Allow data to be specified by state abbreviation or full name in `plot_usmap` and `map_with_data` (instead of just by FIPS code).
  * The data frame passed to `plot_usmap` or `map_with_data` (via the `data =` parameter), can now be a two column data frame with columns "fips" and "values" or "state" and "values".

# usmap 0.2.1
Released Tuesday, August 15, 2017.

### Improvements
* Standardize documentation language.
* Improve descriptiveness of error messages and warnings.
### Bug Fixes
* Allow data passed to `map_with_data` and `plot_usmap` to contain FIPS codes with missing leading zeros.
  * This usually occurs when the codes are read as `numeric` from a `.csv` file.

# usmap 0.2.0
Released Saturday, April 29, 2017.

* Add `map_with_data` function for adding user-defined data to map data.
* Add ability to plot map with data automatically (utilizes new `map_with_data` function).

Released Sunday, January 29, 2017.

* First release

### Main features

* Retrieve US map data frame for merging with data and plotting
* Lookup FIPS codes for states and counties (reverse-lookup as well)
* Map plotting convenience method (uses `ggplot2`)
